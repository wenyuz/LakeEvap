# LakeEvap

The lake responses to global warming are simulated by the lake simulator in the Community Land Model version 5. Lakes (area and depth) are prescribed according to the Global Lake and Wetland Database and simulated by a column lake simulator. The simulation is driven by the 2005â€“2100 atmospheric outputs from the fully coupled run of the Community Climate System Model under the RCP 8.5 scenario. The driving atmospheric forcings include the downward solar and longwave radiation, the atmospheric temperature, humidity, pressure and winds. The heat, moisture and momentum fluxes between the lake and the atmosphere are computed with the bulk transfer approach. The lake temperature is solved based on the surface energy balance. Heat transfer in the water column considers the eddy diffusion, wind-driven mixing, buoyant convection and molecular conduction. More details about the lake simulator can be found in the technical note of the CLM4, available at https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/ccsm4.0/clm/CLM4_Tech_Note.pdf.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14170302/111186260-15974a80-8570-11eb-9e36-0e97fad9fa48.png)
